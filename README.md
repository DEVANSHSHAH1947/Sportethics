# SPORTETHICS - E-commerce Website for Sports Equipment


SPORTETHICS is an e-commerce website for sports enthusiasts who are looking for high-quality sports equipment and ethical sporting goods. Built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, this website is designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience.

This project was developed as a final year project for a friend, but all the coding was done by me.
